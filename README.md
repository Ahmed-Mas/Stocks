# Stocks
Allows user to download next week stock option info into an excel file
Excel sheet will be provided as it has some useful, but completely optional, formatting

1) To start open config and put full path into saveLocation variable

2) Place stock tickers into tickers array

3) Run script

WARNING: this only scrapes NEXT EXPIRING options

Hopefully in the future I'll add:
  1) Download options on chosen week rather than just next week
  2) Scrap stock bid, ask, volume, and related info to allow stronger analysis
  3) Add analysis tools and formulas to better assess stock
  
Enjoy the code, please send suggestions or any feedback to me
